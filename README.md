# Customer Behavior Analysis

This project is a comprehensive data analytics case study focused on understanding customer purchasing behavior using real-world data. The project demonstrates an end-to-end analytics workflow, including data cleaning and exploratory data analysis in Python, SQL-based analysis using relational databases, interactive dashboard creation in Power BI, and business reporting through a structured report and presentation.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to analyze customer shopping behavior to identify patterns, trends, and actionable insights that can help businesses improve decision-making. The project integrates multiple tools and technologies commonly used in industry-level data analytics, making it suitable for both learning and professional portfolio presentation.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data cleaning and exploratory data analysis  
- SQL for querying and analyzing data using relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server  
- Power BI for building interactive dashboards and visual reports  
- Gamma for creating a professional presentation (PPT)  
- CSV files as data sources  

## Dataset Description

The project uses customer shopping data containing information such as customer demographics, purchase details, product categories, and transaction values. The raw dataset is cleaned and transformed to create a structured dataset suitable for analysis, SQL querying, and dashboard development.

## Project Structure

The repository includes Python notebooks for data analysis, CSV files for raw and cleaned datasets, SQL scripts for querying the data, a Power BI dashboard file for visualization, and documentation files for reporting and presentation.

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis begins with data cleaning in Python, where missing values are handled, data types are corrected, and duplicates are removed. Exploratory Data Analysis is then performed to understand customer demographics, spending patterns, and product category performance.

The cleaned data is imported into a relational database, where SQL queries are written to answer business questions such as customer segmentation, total and average spending, and category-wise performance.

An interactive Power BI dashboard is built using the analyzed data to visually present key metrics and insights. Finally, the findings are summarized in a structured report and a presentation created using Gamma for clear communication to stakeholders.

## Key Outcomes

- Identified customer purchasing trends and spending behavior  
- Analyzed product category performance and customer segments  
- Built an interactive Power BI dashboard for business insights  
- Demonstrated practical use of Python, SQL, and BI tools in a single project  

## How to Run the Project

Clone the repository using the command:

git clone https://github.com/Saipushpanjali/Customer-Behavior-Analysis

Open the Python notebook to view and run the data cleaning and EDA steps.  
Use the provided SQL file to run queries in PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQL Server.  
Open the Power BI (.pbix) file in Power BI Desktop to explore the dashboard.

## Future Improvements

Future enhancements may include implementing machine learning models for customer segmentation, automating data pipelines, and deploying dashboards for real-time data updates.
