# Customer Behavior Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior to understand purchasing patterns, customer segmentation, and trends that help businesses make data-driven decisions. The analysis covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and insight generation using Python.

## Project Overview

Customer behavior analysis helps identify how customers interact with products or services by studying their demographics, purchase frequency, spending habits, and preferences. This repository demonstrates an end-to-end data analysis workflow, starting from raw data processing to meaningful business insights.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are to understand customer purchasing behavior, segment customers based on demographics and buying patterns, identify high-value customers, and generate insights that can support marketing and business strategies.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for data, notebooks, and visual outputs. The data folder contains the raw dataset, the notebooks folder contains the Jupyter Notebook used for analysis, and the visuals folder stores charts and plots generated during the analysis. A requirements file is included to list all Python dependencies.

## Dataset

The dataset contains customer-related information such as customer identifiers, age, gender, purchase amount, product category, and purchase date. This data is used to analyze spending trends, customer preferences, and behavioral patterns. Dataset details can be updated once the final data source is confirmed.

## Tools and Technologies

The project is implemented using Python with libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis. All required dependencies can be installed using the requirements.txt file.

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis begins with data loading and cleaning, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates. This is followed by exploratory data analysis to study customer demographics, purchasing trends, and category-wise spending. Customer segmentation is then performed to group customers based on similar behavior. Visualizations are created to clearly present insights and trends.

## Key Insights

The analysis reveals patterns in customer demographics, identifies product categories that generate higher revenue, and highlights the importance of repeat customers in overall sales. These insights can help businesses optimize marketing strategies and improve customer retention.

## How to Run the Project

To run this project, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, install the required Python packages using the requirements file, and open the Jupyter Notebook from the notebooks folder to execute the analysis.

## Future Enhancements

Future improvements may include applying machine learning models for customer clustering or sales prediction, creating interactive dashboards using tools such as Streamlit or Power BI, and automating reports for business use.
